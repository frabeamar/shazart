# Shazart
Ever stared at a masterpiece in a museum and thought, "It’s pretty, but I can't bother to read the tedious description?" Shazart is the Shazam for the art world—with a personality. Search a title, and we’ll skip the dry, crusty textbook jargon. Instead, you get a punchy, fun retelling of the scandals, the secrets, and the "what was the artist thinking?" behind the canvas.
